            A security vulnerability was detected in one or more of Akri's dependencies. For more details, check the output of the [security audit workflow](https://github.com/${{github.repository}}/actions/runs/${{github.run_id}})

            Hint: In most cases, running the [auto-update dependencies](https://github.com/project-akri/akri/actions/workflows/auto-update-dependencies.yml) workflow will fix the issue.
