2. Decide whether you need to add any flags to your PR title, such as `[SAME VERSION]` if the version should not be changed and your change will trigger the version check workflow. This will cause the workflow to automatically succeed: https://github.com/deislabs/akri/blob/main/.github/workflows/check-versioning.yml
3. If this PR closes another issue, add 'closes #<issue number>' somewhere in the PR summary. GitHub will automatically close that issue when this PR gets merged. Alternatively, adding 'refs #<issue number>' will not close the issue, but help provide the reviewer more context. -->
