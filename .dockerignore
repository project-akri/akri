# The Rust binaries are not built with a `docker build`
# command (they are built using Cargo Cross, which I think
# uses a docker run).  Because of this, the Rust src and 
# Cargo.toml files can be ignored by docker.

#    It is not clear to me why !target/*/*/controller
#    does not work here, but it doesn't seem to.  So
#    for now, explicitly specifying each cross-build
#    target and configuration path.
