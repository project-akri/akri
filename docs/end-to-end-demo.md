# End-to-End Demo
In this guide, you will deploy Akri end-to-end, all the way from discovering local video cameras to the footage being streamed on a Web application. You will explore how Akri can dynamically discover devices, deploy brokers pods to perform some action on a device (in this case grabbing video frames and serving them over gRPC), and deploy broker services for obtaining the results of that action.

**Note:** The first step can be performed either via K3s or MicroK8s. Select and
carry out one or the other, then continue on with the rest of the steps. 

## Option 1: Set up single node cluster using K3s
1. Acquire a Linux distro that is supported by K3s, these steps work for Ubuntu.
1. Install [K3s](https://k3s.io/).
    ```sh
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
    ```
1. Grant admin privilege to access kubeconfig.
    ```sh
    sudo addgroup k3s-admin
    sudo adduser $USER k3s-admin
    sudo usermod -a -G k3s-admin $USER
    sudo chgrp k3s-admin /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
    sudo chmod g+r /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
    su - $USER
    ```
1. Check K3s status.
    ```sh
    kubectl get node
    ```
1. Install Helm.
    ```sh
    export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
    sudo apt install -y curl
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
    ```
1. K3s uses its own embedded crictl, so we need to configure the Akri Helm chart with the k3s crictl path and socket.
    ```sh
    export AKRI_HELM_CRICTL_CONFIGURATION="--set agent.host.crictl=/usr/local/bin/crictl --set agent.host.dockerShimSock=/run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock"
    ```

## Option 2: Set up single node cluster using MicroK8s
1. Acquire an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS or 16.04 LTS environment to run the commands. If you would like to deploy the demo to a cloud-based VM, see the instructions for [DigitalOcean](end-to-end-demo-do.md) or [Google Compute Engine](end-to-end-demo-gce.md).
1. Install [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/docs).
    ```sh
    sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.18/stable
    ```
1. Grant admin privilege for running MicroK8s commands.
    ```sh
    sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER
    sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube
    su - $USER
    ```
1. Check MicroK8s status.
    ```sh
    microk8s status --wait-ready
    ```
1. Enable CoreDNS, Helm and RBAC for MicroK8s.
    ```sh
    microk8s enable dns helm3 rbac
    ```
1. If you don't have an existing `kubectl` and `helm` installations, add aliases. If you do not want to set an alias, add `microk8s` in front of all `kubectl` and `helm` commands.
    ```sh
    alias kubectl='microk8s kubectl'
    alias helm='microk8s helm3'
    ```
1. Enable privileged pods and restart microk8s.
    ```sh
    echo "--allow-privileged=true" >> /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/kube-apiserver
    microk8s.stop
    microk8s.start
    ```
1. Akri depends on crictl to track some Pod information. MicroK8s does not install crictl locally, so crictl must be installed and the Akri Helm chart needs to be configured with the crictl path and MicroK8s containerd socket.
    ```sh
    # Note that we aren't aware of any version restrictions
    VERSION="v1.17.0"
    curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/releases/download/$VERSION/crictl-${VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz --output crictl-${VERSION}-linux-amd64.tar.gz
    sudo tar zxvf crictl-$VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
    rm -f crictl-$VERSION-linux-amd64.tar.gz

    export AKRI_HELM_CRICTL_CONFIGURATION="--set agent.host.crictl=/usr/local/bin/crictl --set agent.host.dockerShimSock=/var/snap/microk8s/common/run/containerd.sock"
    ```

## Set up mock udev video devices
1. Install a kernel module to make v4l2 loopback video devices. Learn more about this module [here](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback).
    ```sh
    curl http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/v/v4l2loopback/v4l2loopback-dkms_0.12.5-1_all.deb -o v4l2loopback-dkms_0.12.5-1_all.deb
    sudo dpkg -i v4l2loopback-dkms_0.12.5-1_all.deb
    ```
1. Insert the kernel module, creating /dev/video1 and /dev/video2 devnodes. To create different number video devices modify the `video_nr` argument. 
    ```sh
    sudo modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1 video_nr=1,2
    ```
1. Install Gstreamer main packages
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        libgstreamer1.0-0 gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-libav
    ```
1. Open two new terminals (one for each fake video device), and in each terminal ssh into your ubuntu server that your cluster is running on.
1. In one terminal, stream a test video of a white ball moving around a black background from the first fake video device.
    ```sh
    sudo gst-launch-1.0 -v videotestsrc pattern=ball ! "video/x-raw,width=640,height=480,framerate=10/1" ! avenc_mjpeg ! v4l2sink device=/dev/video1
    ```
    If this generates an error, be sure that there are no existing video streams targeting /dev/video1 (you can query with commands like this: `ps -aux | grep gst-launch-1.0 | grep "/dev/video1"`).
1. In the other terminal, stream a test video of SMPTE 100%% color bars moving horizontally from the second fake video device.
    ```sh
    sudo gst-launch-1.0 -v videotestsrc pattern=smpte horizontal-speed=1 ! "video/x-raw,width=640,height=480,framerate=10/1" ! avenc_mjpeg ! v4l2sink device=/dev/video2
    ```
    If this generates an error, be sure that there are no existing video streams targeting /dev/video2 (you can query with commands like this: `ps -aux | grep gst-launch-1.0 | grep "/dev/video2"`).

## Set up Akri
1. Use Helm to install Akri and create a Configuration to discover local video devices. Create your Configuration by setting values in your install command. Enable the udev Configuration which will search the Linux device filesystem as specified by a udev rule and give it a name. Since we want to find only video devices on the node, specify a udev rule of `KERNEL=="video[0-9]*"`. Also, specify the broker image you want to be deployed to discovered devices. In this case we will use Akri's sample frame server. Since the /dev/video1 and /dev/video2 devices are running on this node, the Akri Agent will discover them and create an Instance for each camera. Watch two broker pods spin up, one for each camera.
    ```sh
    helm repo add akri-helm-charts https://deislabs.github.io/akri/
    helm install akri akri-helm-charts/akri-dev \
        $AKRI_HELM_CRICTL_CONFIGURATION \
        --set useLatestContainers=true \
        --set udev.enabled=true \
        --set udev.name=akri-udev-video \
        --set udev.udevRules[0]='KERNEL==\"video[0-9]*\"' \
        --set udev.brokerPod.image.repository="ghcr.io/deislabs/akri/udev-video-broker:latest-dev"
    ```
    For MicroK8s
    ```sh
    watch microk8s kubectl get pods,akric,akrii -o wide
    ```
    For K3s and vanilla Kubernetes
    ```sh
    watch kubectl get pods,akric,akrii -o wide
    ```
    Run `kubectl get crd`, and you should see the crds listed.
    Run `kubectl get pods -o wide`, and you should see the Akri pods.
    Run `kubectl get akric`, and you should see `akri-udev-video`. If IP cameras were discovered and pods spun up, the instances can be seen by running `kubectl get akrii` and further inspected by runing `kubectl get akrii akri-udev-video-<ID> -o yaml`
    More information about the Akri Helm charts can be found in the [user guide](./user-guide.md#understanding-akri-helm-charts).

1. Inspect the two instances, seeing the correct devnodes in the metadata and that one of the usage slots for each instance was reserved for this node.
    ```sh 
    kubectl get akrii -o yaml
    ```
1. Deploy the steaming web application and watch a pod spin up for the app.
    ```sh
    # This file url is not available while the Akri repo is private.  To get a valid url, open 
    # https://github.com/deislabs/akri/blob/main/deployment/samples/akri-video-streaming-app.yaml
    # and click the "Raw" button ... this will generate a link with a token that can be used below.
    curl -o akri-video-streaming-app.yaml <RAW LINK WITH TOKEN>
    kubectl apply -f akri-video-streaming-app.yaml
    ```
    For MicroK8s
    ```sh
    watch microk8s kubectl get pods -o wide
    ```
    For K3s and vanilla Kubernetes
    ```sh
    watch kubectl get pods -o wide
    ```
1. Determine which port the service is running on.
    ```sh
    kubectl get services
    ```
    Something like the following will be displayed. The ids of the camera services (`udev-camera-<id>-svc`) will likely be different as they are determined by hostname.
    ```
    NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    kubernetes               ClusterIP   10.XXX.XXX.X     <none>        443/TCP        2d5h
    streaming                NodePort    10.XXX.XXX.XX    <none>        80:31143/TCP   41m
    udev-camera-901a7b-svc   ClusterIP   10.XXX.XXX.XX    <none>        80/TCP         42m
    udev-camera-e2548e-svc   ClusterIP   10.XXX.XXX.XX    <none>        80/TCP         42m
    udev-camera-svc          ClusterIP   10.XXX.XXX.XXX   <none>        80/TCP         42m
    ```
1. Navigate in your browser to http://ip-address:31143/ where ip-address is the IP address of your ubuntu VM and the port number is from the output of `kubectl get services`. You should see three videos. The top video streams frames from all udev cameras (from the overarching `udev-camera-svc` service), while each of the bottom videos displays the streams from each of the individual camera services (`udev-camera-901a7b-svc` and `udev-camera-e2548e-svc`). Note: the streaming web application displays at a rate of 1 fps.

## Cleanup 
1. Bring down the streaming service.
    ```sh
    kubectl delete service akri-video-streaming-app
    kubectl delete deployment akri-video-streaming-app
    ```
    For MicroK8s
    ```sh
    watch microk8s kubectl get pods
    ```
    For K3s and vanilla Kubernetes
    ```sh
    watch kubectl get pods
    ```
1. Delete the configuration and watch the instances, pods, and services be deleted.
    ```sh
    kubectl delete akric akri-udev-video
    ```
    For MicroK8s
    ```sh
    watch microk8s kubectl get pods,services,akric,akrii -o wide
    ```
    For K3s and vanilla Kubernetes
    ```sh
    watch kubectl get pods,services,akric,akrii -o wide
    ```
1. Bring down the Akri Agent, Controller, and CRDs.
    ```sh
    helm delete akri
    kubectl delete crd instances.akri.sh
    kubectl delete crd configurations.akri.sh
    ```
1. Stop video streaming on dummy devices and remove kernel module.
    ```sh
    # If terminal has timed out, search for process to kill.
    # ps ax | grep gst-launch-1.0
    # sudo kill <PID>
    sudo modprobe -r v4l2loopback
    ```

## Going beyond the demo
1. Plug in real cameras! You can [pass environment variables](./udev-video-sample.md#modifying-ther-brokerpod-spec) to the frame server broker to specify the format, resolution width/height, and frames per second of your cameras.
1. Apply the [onvif-camera configuration](onvif-configuration.md) and make the streaming app display footage from both the local video devices and onvif cameras. To do this, modify the [video streaming yaml](../deployment/samples/akri-video-streaming-app.yaml) as described in the inline comments in order to create a larger service that aggregates the output from both the `udev-camera-svc` service and `onvif-camera-svc` service.
1. Add more nodes to the cluster.
1. [Modify the udev rule](udev-video-sample.md#modifying-the-udev-rule) to find a more specific subset of cameras.
1. Discover other udev devices by creating a new udev configuration and broker. Learn more about the udev protocol [here](udev-configuration.md).
