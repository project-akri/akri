# Development
This document will walk you through how to set up a local development environment, build Akri component containers, and test Akri using your newly built containers. 

## Required Tools
To develop, you'll need:
- A Linux environment whether on amd64 or arm64v8
- Rust - version 1.41.0 which the build system uses can be installed using: 
    ```sh
    sudo curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain=1.41.0
    cargo version
    ```
- .NET - the ONVIF broker is written in .NET, which can be installed according to [.NET instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu)

In order to cross-build containers for both ARM and x64, several tools are leveraged:

- The [Cross](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross) tool can be installed with this command: `cargo install cross`.
- `qemu` can be installed with:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install -y qemu qemu qemu-system-misc qemu-user-static qemu-user binfmt-support
  ```

  For `qemu` to be fully configured on Ubuntu 18.04, after running apt-get install, run these commands:
  ```sh
    sudo mkdir -p /lib/binfmt.d
    sudo sh -c 'echo :qemu-arm:M::\\x7fELF\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x28\\x00:\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xfe\\xff\\xff\\xff:/usr/bin/qemu-arm-static:F > /lib/binfmt.d/qemu-arm-static.conf'
    sudo sh -c 'echo :qemu-aarch64:M::\\x7fELF\\x02\\x01\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\xb7\\x00:\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xfe\\xff\\xff\\xff:/usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static:F > /lib/binfmt.d/qemu-aarch64-static.conf'
    sudo systemctl restart systemd-binfmt.service
  ```
## Build and Test

### Local builds and tests
1. Navigate to the repo's top folder (where this README is)
1. Install prerequisites
    ```sh
    ./build/setup.sh
    ```
1. Build Controller, Agent, and udev broker
    ```sh
    cargo build
    ```
1. Build ONVIF broker
    ```sh
    cd ./samples/brokers/onvif-video-broker
    dotnet build
    ```

There are unit tests for all of the Rust code.  To run all unit tests, simply navigate to the repo's top folder (where this README is) and type `cargo test`

To locally run the controller as part of a k8s cluster, follow these steps:

1.  Create or provide access to a valid cluster configuration by setting KUBECONFIG (can be done in the commandline) ... for the sake of this, the config is assumed to be in ~/test.cluster.config
1.  Build the repo by running `cargo build`
1.  Run the desired component (in this case, looking at info-level logging and running the controller locally): `RUST_LOG=info KUBECONFIG=~/test.cluster.config ./target/debug/controller`

### To build containers
`Makefile` has been created to help with the more complicated task of building the Akri components and containers for the various supported platforms.

#### Establish a container repository
Containers for Akri are currently hosted in `ghcr.io/deislabs/akri` using the new [GitHub container registry](https://github.blog/2020-09-01-introducing-github-container-registry/). Any container repository can be used for private containers. If you want to enable GHCR, you can follow the [getting started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/getting-started-with-github-container-registry).

To build containers, log into the desired repository:
```sh
CONTAINER_REPOSITORY=<repo>
sudo docker login $CONTAINER_REPOSITORY
```

#### Build intermediate containers
To ensure quick builds, we have created a number of intermediate containers that rarely change.

By default, `Makefile` will try to create containers with tag following this format: `<repo>/$USER/<component>:<label>` where
* `<component>` = rust-crossbuild | opencv-base
* `<repo>` = `devcaptest.azurecr.io`
  * `<repo>` can be overridden by setting `REGISTRY=<desired repo>`
* `$USER` = the user executing `Makefile` (could be `root` if using sudo)
  * `<repo>/$USER` can be overridden by setting `PREFIX=<desired container path>`
* `<label>` = the label is defined in [../build/intermediate-containers.mk](../build/intermediate-containers.mk)

##### Rust cross-build containers
These containers are used by the `cross` tool to crossbuild the Akri Rust code.  There is a container built for each supported platform and they contain any required dependencies for Akri components to build.  The dockerfile can be found here: build/containers/intermediate/Dockerfile.rust-crossbuild-*
  ```sh
  # To make all of the Rust cross-build containers:
  PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY make rust-crossbuild
  # To make specific platform(s):
  PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY BUILD_AMD64=1 BUILD_ARM32=0 BUILD_ARM64=1 make rust-crossbuild
  ```
After building the cross container(s), update [Cross.toml](../Cross.toml) to point to your intermediate container(s).

##### .NET OpenCV containers
These containers allow the ONVIF broker to be created without rebuilding OpenCV for .NET each time.  There is a container built for AMD64 and it is used to crossbuild to each supported platform.  The dockerfile can be found here: build/containers/intermediate/Dockerfile.opencvsharp-build.
  ```sh
  # To make all of the OpenCV base containers:
  PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY make opencv-base
  # To make specific platform(s):
  PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY BUILD_AMD64=1 BUILD_ARM32=0 BUILD_ARM64=1 make opencv-base
  ```

#### Build Akri component containers
By default, `Makefile` will try to create containers with tag following this format: `<repo>/$USER/<component>:<label>` where
* `<component>` = controller | agent | etc
* `<repo>` = `devcaptest.azurecr.io`
  * `<repo>` can be overridden by setting `REGISTRY=<desired repo>`
* `$USER` = the user executing `Makefile` (could be `root` if using sudo)
  * `<repo>/$USER` can be overridden by setting `PREFIX=<desired container path>`
* `<label>` = v$(cat version.txt)
  * `<label>` can be overridden by setting `LABEL_PREFIX=<desired label>`

**Note**: Before building these final component containers, make sure you have built any necessary [intermediate containers](./#build-intermediate-containers). In particular, to build any of the rust containers (the Controller, Agent, or udev broker), you must first [build the cross-build containers](./#rust-cross-build-containers).

```sh
# To make all of the Akri containers:
PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY make akri
# To make a specific component:
PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY make akri-controller
PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY make akri-agent
PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY make akri-udev
PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY make akri-onvif
PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY make akri-streaming

# To make a specific component on specific platform(s):
PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY BUILD_AMD64=1 BUILD_ARM32=0 BUILD_ARM64=1 make akri-streaming

# To make a specific component on specific platform(s) with a specific label:
PREFIX=$CONTAINER_REPOSITORY LABEL_PREFIX=latest BUILD_AMD64=1 BUILD_ARM32=0 BUILD_ARM64=1 make akri-streaming
```

**NOTE:** If your docker install requires you to use `sudo`, this will conflict with the `cross` command.  This flow has helped:
```sh
sudo -s
source /home/$SUDO_USER/.cargo/env

# run make commands that crossbuild the Rust

exit
```

## Install Akri with newly built containers
When installing Akri using helm, you can set the `imagePullSecrets`, `image.repository` and `image.tag` [Helm values](../deployment/helm/values.yaml) to point to your newly created containers. For example, to install Akri with with custom Controller and Agent containers, run the following, specifying the `image.tag` version to reflect [version.txt](../version.txt):
```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry <your-secret-name> --docker-server=ghcr.io  --docker-username=<your-github-alias> --docker-password=<your-github-token>
helm repo add akri-helm-charts https://deislabs.github.io/akri/
helm install akri akri-helm-charts/akri-dev \
    --set imagePullSecrets[0].name="<your-secret-name>" \
    --set agent.image.repository="ghcr.io/<your-github-alias>/agent" \
    --set agent.image.tag="v<akri-version>-amd64" \
    --set controller.image.repository="ghcr.io/<your-github-alias>/controller" \
    --set controller.image.tag="v<akri-version>-amd64"
```

More information about the Akri Helm charts can be found in the [user guide](./user-guide.md#understanding-akri-helm-charts).

## Other useful Helm Commands
### Helm Package
If you make changes to anything in the [helm folder](../deployment/helm), you will probably need to create a new Helm chart for Akri. This can be done using the [`helm package`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_package/) command. To create a chart using the current state of the Helm templates and CRDs, run (from one level above the Akri directory) `helm package akri/deployment/helm/`. You will see a tgz file called `akri-<akri-version>.tgz` at the location where you ran the command. Now, install Akri using that chart:
```sh
helm install akri akri-<akri-version>.tgz \
    --set useLatestContainers=true
```
### Helm Template
When you install Akri using Helm, Helm creates the DaemonSet, Deployment, and Configuration yamls for you (using the values set in the install command) and applies them to the cluster. To inspect those yamls before installing Akri, you can use [`helm template`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_template/). 
For example, you will see the image in the Agent DaemonSet set to `image: "ghcr.io/<your-github-alias>/agent:v<akri-version>-amd64"` if you run the following:
```sh
helm template akri deployment/helm/ \
  --set imagePullSecrets[0].name="<your-secret-name>" \
  --set agent.image.repository="ghcr.io/<your-github-alias>/agent" \
  --set agent.image.tag="v<akri-version>-amd64"
```

### Helm Get Manifest
Run the following to inspect an already running Akri installation in order to see the currently applied yamls such as the Configuration CRD, Instance CRD, protocol Configurations, Agent DaemonSet, and Controller Deployment:
```sh
helm get manifest akri | less
```

### Helm Upgrade
To modify a Akri installation to reflect a new state, you can use [`helm upgrade`](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/). See the [modifying a Akri installation document](./modifying-akri-installation.md) for further explanation.
