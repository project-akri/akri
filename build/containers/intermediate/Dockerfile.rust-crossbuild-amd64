# This Dockerfile is used to create intermediate containers used
# by the Akri build.
#
# Any changes to this file need to be made in its own Pull Request
# and need include a change to Makefile's BUILD_RUST_CROSSBUILD_VERSION.
#
# A second Pull Request should subsequently be made to update
# Cross.toml to point at the new versions.
