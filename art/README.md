# AKRI Logo & Assets


## Logo

This directory contains the AKRI icon and logo in different settings. Choose the format that works best for the scenario in which the logo is being used:

* Is the background light or dark?
* Is there more vertical or horizontal space to work with?
* Will the logo appear alongside the project name (like on a social media profile avatar)? If so, omit the workmark and just use the icon. Avatars should retain white space around the branding to ensure it is not cropped or squished when viewed in context. 

## Typography

AKRI's wordmark uses rounded, playful lettering. Ideally complimentary text should follow these attributes - I recommend the [Varela Round](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela+Round) typeface, a rounded, soft and playful sans-serif typeface created by Joe Prince. These fonts are licensed under the Open Font License.
